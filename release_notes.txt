release notes v. 1.1
********************

install.sh & substring-A.py
- changed name of libraries folder from 'libs' to 'mwetk' in line with changes in the latest version of the mwetoolkit

cutoff.sh
- added option that allows processing of file in Google n-gram format


release notes v. 1.0
********************

A new, modular architecture was introduced, splitting SubString into three modules. The main algorithm of SubString up to version 0.9.9.2 was retained as one of the modules and a new module (substring-A.py) added that implements a frequency consolidation algorithm that makes use of mwetoolkit's indexing of n-grams. The auxiliary scripts were retained as the third module.

substring.sh
- adjusted to the modular architecture

TP-filter, cutoff.sh, random_lines.sh, length-adjust.sh
- changed handling of filename extensions so that extensions are preserved correctly

substring-processor.sh
- renamed substring-B.sh

newly added:
- substring-A.py
- libs/filetype/ft_ngp.py & ft_nsp.py
- xml_list_to_NGP.py
- TUTORIAL.md
- plaintext_list.xsl


release notes v. 0.9.9.2
************************

substring-processor.sh
- raised limit of number of uncut lists to be incorporated in the consolidation to 12.

TP-filter.sh
- added option to rate on a scale from 1 to 6 rather than a binary T/F distinction.


release notes v. 0.9.9.1
************************

substring-processor.sh
- fixed an issue with the progress indicator not advancing during the preparatory stage


release notes v. 0.9.9
**********************

substring.sh
- added a menu-based interface
- moved main processing code to new substring-processor.sh

Added the following auxiliary scripts used by substring.sh
- consolidate.sh
- en-filter.sh
- random_lines.sh
- TP-filter.sh
- substring-processor.sh

listconv.sh
- script was retired as the NGP package now provides suitably formatted input files.

Removed awk commands from all scripts due to compatibility issues with Cygwin in certain configurations

Adjusted the following to reflect above changes
- install.sh
- README.pdf/README.md:
- test_data


release notes v. 0.9.7
**********************

Added double-clickable installers for Cygwin and a generic installer script:
- Cygwin_installer.lnk
- Cygwin64_installer.lnk
- install.sh

README.pdf/README.md:
- adjusted for changes

release notes v. 0.9.6
**********************

Added double-clickable installer for OS X and Linux:
- OSX_installer.command
- linux_installer.desktop

README.pdf/README.md:
- adjusted for changes

release notes v. 0.9.5
**********************

substring.sh:
- prep stage processing now makes use of Bash 4's associative arrays â€“ this 
  enables the processing of far larger amounts of data (previous algorythm 
  still works if no bash 4 is detected)
- fixed bug introduced in 0.9.4 which resulted in hung processing if the -d
  option was invoked
- removed trailing tabs from output lists inadvertently introduced in 0.9.4
- a few other efficiency improvements

README.txt/README.md:
- adjusted for changes

test_data:
- updated gold lists to reflect changes to substring.sh

release notes v. 0.9.4
**********************

README.txt/README.md:
- adjusted for changes
- description for length-adjust.sh added

substring.sh:
- consolidation down to single words enabled (before it was down to bigrams)
- fixed some linux-specific issues with coreutil's cut
- fixed an issue where a warning was issued about unexpected format in lists
  had n-grams with underscores in them
- efficiency improved by reducing the number of I/Os
- improved accuracy during imports at preparatory stage

cutoff.sh:
- improved efficiency
- introduced -i option for improved naming of cutoff lists

length-adjust.sh (new):
- newly added script to adjust lengths of certain n-grams after consolidation

listconv.sh:
- fixed bug in -n option
- expanded number of input list formats handled

test_data:
- updated gold lists to reflect changes to substring.sh
- new data in example3 that includes word lists
- new example4

release notes v. 0.9.1
**********************

README.txt: 
- adjusted for new home page url
- adjusted to reflect changes below

cutoff.sh, listconv.sh, substring.sh:
- now operate with flexible n-gram constituent separators for compatibility
  with the N-Gram Processor (http://buerki.github.io/ngramprocessor)
  
test_data
- added GOLD standard lists

release notes v. 0.9
********************

README.txt: 
- adjusted recommended installation directory 

cutoff.sh: 
- added -n N option which restricts the cutoff to n-grams of size N. This
  is useful if a list with different lengths of n-grams (such as after 
  consolidation with substring.sh) needs to have length-specific cutoffs
  applied. The -n option only processes lists of formats 'n<>gram<> 370' or
  'n<>gram<>	370	258'
- expanded help available in -h option

substring.sh:
- added an identifyer line to the neg-freq.lst file which logs negative
  frequencies
- renamed the -m option to -n option as this is a more easily remembered name
  for the option to retain negative frequency strings and 0-frequency strings in
  the output lists
- added -z option to include sequences with zero-frequency (but not with
  negative frequency) in the final output list 
- adjusted help (-h) accordingly

release notes v. 0.8.7
**********************
substring.sh:
- added -d option which will preserve any document counts that may be present
  in source lists and reduced those document counts to maximally be equal to the
  frequency each n-gram
- added -f option to sort output lists in decending order of n-gram frequency
- added a check to make sure no n-grams are doubly imported during the prep
  stage
- added a checking stage where input lists are checked for the right format
  before being processed
- fixed a minor bugs that could result in premature exiting of the script under
  certain conditions

cutoff.sh:
- adjusted verbose behaviour to list the input files that will be processed
- adjusted naming of output files to prevent overwriting of existing files
  with identical names.

README.txt: adjusted to document new -d option in substring.sh

release notes v. 0.8.2
**********************
- adjusted test_data
- substring.sh: adjusted mktemp call to work with both GNU (coreutils) 7.4 and the BSD version included in MacOS



release notes v. 0.8.1
**********************

substring.sh
------------
- filtered and unfiltered input lists are now tested to make sure they contain consecutive n-sizes.
- the script now tests if unfiltered lists are supplied that contain n-grams that are larger than the maximum n-size of filtered lists +1 and complains if that is the case
- document counts and other digits AFTER the frequency are now retained in the output lists (they are simply copied over from the source lists untouched)

listconv.sh
-----------
adjusted NOT to place an empty document count digit (i.e.) at the end of each line when no real document count is present in the source list.



release notes v. 0.8
********************

The functionality of substrd.sh, core_substring.sh and prep_stage.sh has been integrated into a new script: substring.sh. Additionally, the entire code was looked over and re-written in many places. Specifically,
- processing now takes place in a secure temporary directory, thus minimising the danger of interference
- the passing of arguments was simplified, now all arguments must be passed overtly (version 0.7's automatic mode was removed).
- the number of negative frequencies is reduced in some cases by allowing the use of unfiltered lists of size n+1 when the largest filtered list containing n-grams is of size n.
- minor adjustments to the help functions of all scripts
- new examples and updated documentation in README.txt
