<div style="font-family: monospace; text-align: center;">The
SubString package is a cross-platform, open-source set of scripts used for<br>
substring reduction and frequency consolidation of word n-grams. It consists<br>
&nbsp;of three separate command-line modules (substring-A, substring-B and an<br>
auxiliary scripts module). Substring-A and -B each implement a different algorithm<br>
for consolidating the frequencies of word n-grams of different lengths (i.e. of<br>
different <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>). The process of frequency consolidation reduces the frequencies<br>
of substrings by the frequencies of the superstrings in which they are contained<br>
and an output list is produced showing the consolidated frequencies of all<br>
n-grams (see below for more on frequency consolidation). The auxiliary<br>
scripts module provides a number of additional functions related to the<br>
filtering of n-gram lists. The functions performed by this package will primarily<br>
be of interest to linguists and computational linguists working on formulaic<br>
language, multi-word expressions and other phraseological phenomena.<br>
<br>substring-A (algorithm with indexation)<br>
<br>
This is a python script designed to work in conjunction with the <a href="http://mwetoolkit.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php" target="_blank">mwetoolkit</a>.<br>
It takes as input a corpus-indexed list of n-grams (as produced by mwetoolkit)<br>
and then uses an exact, indexation-based algorithm to consolidate frequencies<br>
of overlapping n-grams, following <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjRO8cY0xwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Theory+and+Practice+in+Corpus+Linguistics+1990&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqvf6q_IDdAhUHJMAKHapOClAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Theory%20and%20Practice%20in%20Corpus%20Linguistics%201990&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Altenberg and Eeg-Olofsson (1990: 16-17)</a>.<br>
<br>
The Substring-A algorithm is generally preferable to substring-B in cases <br>
where access is available to the source texts/corpora from which n-grams are to <br>
be extracted, and mwetoolkit can be used to extract n-grams from those texts.<br>
<br>
substring-B (algorithm without indexation)<br>
<br>
This is a set of Unix shell scripts designed to work on a range of simpler n-gram <br>
list formats (where n-grams are not indexed to their occurrences in a specific<br>
&nbsp;corpus). Such lists are produced by the <a href="http://buerki.github.io/ngramprocessor/" target="_blank">NGramProcessor</a>, the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/%7Etpederse/nsp.html" target="_blank">Ngram Statistics<br>
Package</a> and various other tools and sources such as <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html" target="_blank">Google Books Ngrams</a>.<br>
The algorithm implemented by substring-B is described in detail in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-69805-2_30" target="_blank">Buerki (2017)</a>.<br>
<br>
If access to source texts/corpora is unavailable (only n-gram lists are available) <br>
or if the limitations of mwetoolkit mean that a different tool needs to be used<br>
&nbsp;for n-gram extraction, substring-B should be used. Access to source corpora may be<br>
&nbsp;unavailable in case of sources like Google Books Ngrams, or because online corpus <br>
portals such as the <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu" target="_blank">Sketch Engine</a> are used that allow the creation of n-gram lists,<br>
&nbsp;but not the download of the full underlying corpus data. N-gram lists might require<br>
some formatting before processing, see the README file for substring-B.<br>
<br>
auxiliary scripts<br>
<br>
Several auxiliary scripts are included in the SubString package which allow the further<br>
&nbsp;processing of n-gram lists after frequency consolidation. These scripts can be used<br>
after processing with substring-A or substring-B. See the TUTORIAL included in <br>
SubString for details on these scripts.<br>
